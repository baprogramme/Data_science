    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) provides the probability distribution for discrete variables. For example, rolling dice. There are 6 distinct possible outcomes that define the entire sample space {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Note that we only have whole numbers, i.e. no 1.2 or 3.75. In the PMF, each discrete variable is mapped to its probability. In an ideal situation rolling a die, each of the six variables has a 1/6 probability of being rolled.\n",
